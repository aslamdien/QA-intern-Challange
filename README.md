## Practical Exercise: 

### test case:
**To create the OMBD API you must:**
  - First head to "http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx" to genrate a new api key.
  - Select the "FREE! (1000 daily limit)" option and enter email address, name surname, and reason to generate api and then submit.
  - Once sumbit, an email should be sent to your email address containing your api key and an activation URL to active your API.


**To replicate quary with API for "Thor: Ragnorok":**
  - Copy the link in email sent to you and paste in to the browser`s navigation bar.(http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey={apikey}&i={IMDBid})
  - You will redirected to a page with information of a random movie in JSON form.
  - To the information for "Thor: Ragnarok", change the "i" parameter (the IMDB id number) to "tt3501632" in the navigation bar.

## Theoretical Exercise answers:

1. 
-Test case: Are a set of actions or instructions for a tester or QA professional to perform inorder to approve a specific aspect of a product or application functionality.

-User story: To give a decription of functionality from the perspective the user inorder to find ways of make the software or product more user friendly.

2. The best time for automated testing should be when the functionality has been build so in order look over and locate the bugs in the code and make the corrections before merging it into the repository.

3. STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle, it is a list of acivities performed by a testing team to effectively ensure that the quality of the software is fully functional. 

4. The best time for a software quality engineer to get involved in a project would when the product has being tested before the it ready to be deployed and when the software is going through maintenance.

5. -For Manual testing it should be about 20% mostly at end of buliding the software
   -For Automated testing it be aleast 80% as to keep track of the coding and inorder to avoid running into bugs less while creating the code.
